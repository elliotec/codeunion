#Code Union

This is a project for Code Fellows that aggregates good learning resources for code. 

Group Members:
Katie Brasfield
Mark Palfreeman
Garrett Sand

Comments
We added the ability for users to comment on resources. Admins/moderators can search for all comments on all resources and delete them as needed. The ability for users to edit comments was intentionally not included.

Search
We implemented search functionality using solr, sunspot and websolr.
